## Coding tests

Choose 2 of the following 3 problems and send the answers by email to [devs](mailto:devs@poupachef.com.br). The tests can be  solved in any programming language.

### 1

UTF-8 is a variable leght character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

- For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
- For an n-byte character, the first byte starts with n ones and a zero. The other n - 1 bytes all start with 10.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### 2

Implement the function fib(n), which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, using only O(1) space.

---

### 3

Spreadsheets often use this alphabetical encoding for its columns: "A", "B", "C", ..., "AA", "AB", ..., "ZZ", "AAA", "AAB", ....

Given a column number, return its alphabetical column id. For example, given 1, return "A". Given 27, return "AA".

### Good luck
